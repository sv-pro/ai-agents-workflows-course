This repository contains code snapshots and slides for my [AI Agents & Workflows - The Practical Guide](https://acad.link/ai-agents) course.

# About The Code

If you want to run the code, navigate to the folder in [/code](/code/) you're interested in, install dependencies (via `uv sync` using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) as a package / project manager) and add any potentially required API keys to the `.env` file.

Please note: All code examples are demos! If you want to use them in production, you should carefully evaluate them, adjust them for your specific use-case, test them, harden them (add more robust error handling) and consider potential risks like prompt injection.
